# Project Euler 100

## Introduction

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require creative solutions. The goal of Project Euler 100 is to solve the first 100 problems from the Project Euler website.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to improve your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and programming abilities. By solving these problems, you will gain a deeper understanding of various mathematical concepts and learn how to apply them in a programming context.

## Getting Started

To get started with Project Euler 100, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net/) and create an account if you haven't already.
2. Read the problem descriptions and choose the problem you want to solve.
3. Implement a solution to the problem using your preferred programming language.
4. Test your solution to ensure it produces the correct output.
5. Submit your solution on the Project Euler website to check if it's correct.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for the remaining problems.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have a more efficient solution to a problem or want to add a new problem to the collection, feel free to submit a pull request.
