# Problem  78 Coin Partition
Let represent the number of different ways in which coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so:
1) OOOOO
2) OOOO   O
3) OOO   O O
4) OOO   O   O
5) OO   O O   O
6) O O   O   O   O
7) O   O   O   O   O

Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.
